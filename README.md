## Description
This is my first Xamarin application. The purpose of this application was to get familar with a new technology. It was a great experience 
and am looking forward to creating more applications using Xamarin.

For this specific project I created an application that will display to the user images that I've taken while abroad. In order to do so, the user must click the next button above each image.


## Application Specifications
